 * This class is to support reading CRLF terminated lines that
 * contain only US-ASCII characters from an input stream. Provides
 * functionality that is similar to the deprecated
 * <code>DataInputStream.readLine()</code>. Expected use is to read
 * lines as String objects from a RFC822 stream.
 *
 * It is implemented as a FilterInputStream, so one can just wrap
 * this class around any input stream and read bytes from this filter.
